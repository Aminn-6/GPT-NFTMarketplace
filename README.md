# NFT Marketplace Project

This project demonstrates an NFT marketplace running on a local blockchain using Ganache. Below are the step-by-step instructions to set up and run the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- Ganache GUI
- Metamask (browser extension)
- Pinata (for handling IPFS storage)

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository and navigate to the project folder.

```bash
npm install
cd NFT_Market
```

### 2. Start the Application

Start the application locally using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Run Ganache

Open **Ganache GUI** and start a new workspace. This will launch a local Ethereum blockchain.

### 4. Connect Metamask to Ganache

1. Open **Metamask** in your browser.
2. Create a new network for Ganache by following these steps:
    - **Network Name**: `Ganache Local`
    - **RPC URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:7545`
    - **Chain ID**: `1337`
    - **Currency Symbol**: `ETH`
3. Click "Save" to add the Ganache network.

### 5. Import Ganache Account into Metamask

1. In Ganache, copy the **Private Key** of the first account.
2. In Metamask, go to **Import Account** and paste the copied private key to import the account.

### 6. Pinata API Key Setup

1. Create an account on [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/).
2. Go to **API Keys** and create new keys.
3. Copy the **API Key** and **Secret Key**.

### 7. Set Up the `.env` File

You will need to create a `.env` file in your project root directory to store your **API Keys**, **Private Key**, and other sensitive data securely.

#### Create a `.env` file

1. In the root of the project folder, create a new file named `.env`.
2. Add the following keys with the correct values:

```env
# .env

PRIVATE_KEY=your-ganache-private-key
ALCHEMY_API_URL=your-alchemy-api-url
PINATA_API_KEY=your-pinata-api-key
PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your-pinata-secret-key
```

Replace the placeholders with the actual values:
- **PRIVATE_KEY**: Use the private key from your Ganache account.
- **ALCHEMY_API_URL**: If you're deploying to an Ethereum testnet (e.g., Sepolia), you will need an Alchemy API URL. You can get this by signing up on [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).
- **PINATA_API_KEY** and **PINATA_SECRET_KEY**: These are the keys you obtained from Pinata for uploading your NFT metadata to IPFS.

#### Changing `.env` Values

- You can update the values in the `.env` file whenever needed. For example, if you switch to a different network or change accounts in Ganache, you should update the **PRIVATE_KEY**.
- If you decide to deploy on a testnet (like Sepolia), you will need to replace the **ALCHEMY_API_URL** with your Alchemy project's URL for that specific network.
  
Make sure you **never expose your private key or API keys** in a public repository. The `.env` file is automatically ignored if you have a `.gitignore` file that includes `.env`.

### 8. Compiling and Deploying the Smart Contracts

1. Open **VS Code** and navigate to the project directory.
2. Clean and compile the smart contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat compile
```

3. Deploy the contracts to the local Ganache network:

```bash
npx hardhat run ./script/deploy.js --network localganache
```

This will deploy your NFT marketplace smart contract to the Ganache network.

## Additional Information

- Ensure your `.env` file contains accurate values for the **PRIVATE_KEY**, **ALCHEMY_API_URL**, and **Pinata** keys. Without the correct values, contract deployment and IPFS interactions may fail.
  
- Make sure to always keep your `.env` file secure and never push it to public repositories.

---

This setup should allow you to run the NFT marketplace locally, interact with it through Metamask, and upload NFT metadata to IPFS using Pinata.
